TABLE localstock:

'code' is the actual shoe ( what we are picking )
'groupid' lets us link with other tables for identify other details.
'location' is the location of the pick.
'brand' is helpful for finding the pick as it lets us know the brand of the shoe.

'ordernum' - if ordernum is '#FREE' it is NOT a pick. if there is anything other than '#FREE' in ordernum and 'qty' is 1, it is a pick. ( generally it will start with BC)

'qty' if it is a pick it will ALWAYS be qty 1. if it has been picked the qty will be 0.

1 = to be picked
0 = picked


TABLE skusummary:

this table is linked by the groupid and contains any other information we might need.
