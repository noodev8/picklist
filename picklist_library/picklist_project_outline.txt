I want to create a pick app for a warehouse using dart/flutter.
It will allow users to see what picks need picking and to select one and mark it as 'picked'


It will connect to a postgreSQL database
The database already exists.
The table is called 'localstock' and we will be checking for rows where the ordernum != '#FREE'. We then want to display the ordernum and code.

It will have: 
	- A home page where the user can login
	- once logged in there will be 5 buttons:
		- C3-Front
		- C3-Back
		- C3-Crocs
		- C3-Shop
		- C1

when the user presses a button it will show all the picks from that location ( the location needs to include the words on the button in the query )
