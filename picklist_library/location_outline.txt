this is how our warehouse locations work:

we have digits before the first '-' sign that represent the building. for example 'C1-Rack-01' will be in building 1.
The the second section is a description. so if it's a basket or a rack ect.
finally the numbers at the end represent the actual location/rack.

For example C3-Rack-02 will mean it's in building C3, on rack number 2.

Our main locations which we want represented in the app are:
- C3-Front
- C3-Back
- C3-Crocs
- C1
- C3-Shop

the picker goes to those main locations and then the individual rack to find their pick.
